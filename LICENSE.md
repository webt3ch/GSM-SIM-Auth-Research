# GSM SIM Authentication Protocol (Technical Overview)

## Phase 1: Initialization
- Power up SIM (C1 VCC)
- Apply Reset (C2 RESET)
- Terminal reads ATR (Answer to Reset)

## Phase 2: Challenge-Response
- Terminal sends APDU `A0 88 00 00 10` with RAND (16 bytes)
- SIM responds with SRES (4 bytes)

## Phase 3: Session Key Derivation
- SIM calculates Kc (8 bytes)
- Kc can be used to encrypt data link
